- How to check a variable's type?
Ans: type() function

- In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
Ans: SyntaxError occurs when you are trying to name a variable in a wrong/illegal/nonconventional way. It can also occurs when you are trying to assign one of the keywords in Python to a value.
Ex:
3s = 2
a u = 3
$ = 2
True = 200
